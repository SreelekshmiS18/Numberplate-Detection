# Numberplate-Detection
Number Plate Detection (Including Blurred Plates) using OpenCV & Haarcascade
This project implements Number Plate Detection, including the detection of blurred number plates, using OpenCV and Haarcascade classifiers. The system is capable of identifying number plates in images and handling cases where plates are partially obscured or blurred.

Features
Number Plate Detection using pre-trained Haarcascade classifiers.
Blurred Number Plate Detection with additional preprocessing techniques.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Haarcascade Classifier
